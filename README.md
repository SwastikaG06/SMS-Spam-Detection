📩 SMS Spam Detection Using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an intelligent SMS Spam Detection system using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to automatically classify SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) by analyzing the text content of messages.

With the increasing number of unwanted promotional and fraudulent messages, spam detection has become an important real-world application of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project demonstrates how text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms can be combined to solve this problem effectively.
